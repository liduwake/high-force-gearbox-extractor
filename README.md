# High-Force Gearbox Shaft Extractor & Installer

High-force mechanical tool designed for **controlled gearbox shaft disassembly and installation** (press-fit).  
Developed and validated on a production BMW gearbox, the internal gear mechanism generates **over 5000 N of controlled axial force** using Autodesk Fusion 360.

## Overview
This project presents a mechanical tool designed to support two critical gearbox service operations:

1. **Shaft extraction / disassembly** — removing tightly fitted or interference-fitted shafts in a controlled manner  
2. **Shaft installation / assembly** — pressing shafts back into position with alignment control (press-fit)

The design focuses on generating high, controllable axial force through an internal gear-based transmission mechanism, enabling safe, repeatable, and gradual force application in both directions.

The project is intended for **engineering practice, reverse engineering, and mechanical design demonstration**, rather than direct commercial manufacturing.

## Engineering Background
During gearbox maintenance and reverse-engineering work, both removing and reinstalling press-fitted shafts require:

- Significant axial force
- Precise coaxial alignment
- Controlled, incremental load application to avoid damage

This tool was developed to address those requirements by:
- Converting manual input into high axial force
- Maintaining alignment during both extraction and installation
- Providing controlled, step-by-step movement for repeatable operation

The design was **validated on a production automotive gearbox (BMW)** as a real-world reference case.

## Scope of Work and Responsibility
This repository focuses on the **tool’s internal force-generation and alignment mechanism**, including:

- Internal gear train and force amplification mechanism  
- Load path and structural load transfer components  
- Shaft alignment and coaxial guidance features  
- Assembly structure and mechanical constraints  

Any gearbox components visible in assembly views are included **only as reference context** and are **not part of the tool design**.
